__AaltoWindraw__
=============

Overview
--------

This project is part of the course _T-111.5350 Multimedia Programming_ at __Aalto University__.

Basically, it is a port of classic boardgame _Pictionary_ to the __Aalto Window platform__.

For people waking up from 30 years of sleep, rules are as follow :
* Two players (or two teams)
* One of them has to draw something
* The other has to guess what this something is

It is kind of similar to some other game:
_Draw Something_ ( _Android_, _Iphone_)

__Aalto Window Platforms__ are _Microsoft PixelSense_ tables buffed up with some awesome tools ( _Kinect_, APIs and so on) and located on the three campus of __Aalto University__.

They prove to be the archetypal platform for the kind of game that __AaltoWindraw__ is.
